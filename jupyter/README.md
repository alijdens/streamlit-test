# Jupyter server

Adds a startup script that will initialize the database connection to Postgres in order to be used with the `%sql` magic (provided by the `ipython-sql` package).

See the [`example.ipynb`](http://localhost:8888/lab/workspaces/auto-S/tree/example.ipynb) notebook for an example on how to use it with Pandas to plot a histogram form the DB data (you can open it from Jupyter to interact with it).
